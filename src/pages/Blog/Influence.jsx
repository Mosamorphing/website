        <h1>
          On knowing the influences that shape your life and being true to
          yourself.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I remember how I’d just become more active on Twitter (especially
          design twitter) in 2018–2019 and how there were conversations around
          being a generalist vs specialist. It was a big conversation that was
          happening every 2 market days and I remember how some of the top guys
          spoke in favour of being a specialist; “pick one thing and get so good
          at it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I woke up this morning thinking, “man, thank God I didn’t listen”. I
          don’t “actively” design anymore but it’s 2024 and I’ve seen folks who
          were big on being a “specialist” say otherwise today. They want to
          pick up a skill that compliments what they already do, and if they get
          good enough at it to offer it as another standalone skill, why not?
        </p>
        <p>Here’s the point I’m trying to make;</p>
        <p>
          You’ve got to pay very close attention to yourself. Assess who you
          are, where you’re coming from and where you hope to be. Figure out
          what takes YOU there. If you can’t figure it out, at least count the
          cost. No matter who you look at, regardless of how similar your
          journey looks or how well you think you know them, you are the only
          person that you truly know.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know your history more than anybody else, your struggles, your
          fears, your psyche. You may not know why you think the way you do, but
          you’re the only person that has all the pointers to the why, in
          detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you aspire to be like this person or that person you truly don’t
          know what makes them, them. All you have is a persona. You’ve built an
          idea of them in your head based on what they post, say, or show.
          That’s not them, or better put, that’s not all of them.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="styled-blockquote">
          To accurately apply a person’s judgment, point of view or
          “authoritative advice” on an issue to your life, you’ve got to know
          them in their entirety, because everybody speaks contextually.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          But we’re mostly blinded from the context people speak from. We don’t
          know people in their entirety, even married people agree to this. We
          only know pieces and parts of the people around us/influences that
          shape us. But we make decisions based on their judgments regardless,
          because we look similar, in some type of way. And I get it. We all
          need direction, and that’s okay.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make decisions every day, big or small, and they all shape our
          lives in every way, big or small. However, there are 2 things I
          recommend that you consider when making decisions based on an external
          judgment.
        </p>
        <h2>First recommendation: </h2>
        <p>
          You must own every decision you’re about to make. Owning it means that
          if it doesn’t go as planned or you do not see the same results as
          you’d hoped you’d see, compared to where you got the idea/decision,
          you’re going to take full responsibility for it. “yes, I heard it from
          this person or that person, but I TOOK THE DECISION”. When things go
          sideways or you see no result, you’re able to live with yourself. I
          think this is why we’ve come to hate motivational speakers and tag
          them liars. Also, it helps your heart in a lot of ways I don’t want to
          go into right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for context, I had a similar experience about a year ago and while
          I was very convinced that taking the decision wasn’t best for me at
          the moment, I listened to this external “advice” and yup, things went
          sideways, and I lost something valuable in the process. I was in pain
          and angered, and almost couldn’t live with myself. Until I started to
          own it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You could have refused, but you didn’t. You were sure that it wasn’t
          the best judgment but you went with it anyway. No matter how much it
          looks like the “adviser” made you do it, you did it yourself.” I told
          myself that. It was a difficult conversation with myself, but it made
          me better. I learnt from it and was able to move forward.
        </p>

        <h2>Second recommendation: </h2>
        <p>“To thyself be true”</p>
        <p>
          You’ve got to pay very very close attention to yourself. You’ve got to
          know yourself; where you’re coming from, where you are, and where you
          hope to be. You may have heard that several times but I’ll add to
          that; in the process of knowing yourself, you’ve got to be honest with
          whatever you find, good or not so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve got to identify your leverages. The ones you have and the ones
          you do not have. If daddy is a reckless drunk and it affects the
          household income, that’s part of where you’re coming from. You’ve got
          to be honest with that. If mommy does all the hustling and manages to
          send you to a good school (a type of leverage), this is also part of
          where you’re coming from, be honest about that. If you’re the “Ada”
          and you had to grow up fast to help the household, you’ve got to be
          honest with that. Leave no factor out of this. Turn over every stone.
          The fine and the ugly ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, you’ve got to be honest about the mindsets you’ve built due to
          your peculiar background. If you’re from a high-income background, you
          know summer vacations outside of the country were no issue for you.
          There are some risks you can take on a whim. If you’re not from such
          household, you know you have to do calculations and plot a graph or
          two, and probably answer a family meeting on how it looks like you’ve
          suddenly gone mad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I cannot say this enough; in the process of finding and knowing
          yourself, with the circumstances that make you you, you’ve got to be
          honest with yourself and the things you find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I found a hardcopy bible I owned in 2021 and at the back of
          it, I wrote 2 rules that guided my life at the time. The 2nd rule
          reads “Ask yourself the hard questions (to provocation)”.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people ask themselves the hard questions, they mostly find what
          they do not like and are not willing to confront. One of the things
          social media helps us with is that it allows many of us to escape
          these realities and the things we find. Because of the people we
          “follow” and consider to be in “better places” than us, we create a
          world of fantasy for ourselves. Somewhere we would rather be,
          forgetting our own realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We somehow think engaging them, talking like them and acting like them
          makes us them. While this may be a good way to develop new ways of
          seeing life, it doesn’t solve the fundamental issues, and you’ve got
          to be willing to confront the fundamental issues. Without doing that,
          you’re angered at your current, real world and left constantly
          yearning for your world of fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have nothing against fantasy but when you assess these fundamental
          issues, you’re more equipped. You’re armed with an acute knowledge of
          where you are and because of that, you’re informed about what it will
          take you to make your world of fantasy a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, that’s it my friends. Own every decision, and “to thyself, be
          true”.
        </p>
        <p className="border-b pb-3">
          I pray that the light will always guide you. Till some other time,
          blessings.
