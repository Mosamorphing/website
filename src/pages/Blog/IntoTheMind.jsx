        <h1>Into the Mind of 4 Gen-X Yoruba Men and a Gen-Z Observer</h1>
        <p>
          Earlier today under the rising hot weather, I had a musing and it goes
          thus:
        </p>
        <p>
          “Is a unified Nigeria really unrealistic? Are there nations that are
          as disintegrated as Nigeria? Are there nations that were once
          disintegrated but found a way to sustainable unification?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sooner than I expected, as if by providence, I was in the midst of 4
          Yoruba Gen-X men and discussion about the just concluded presidential
          election began. 3 Muslims, 1 Christian but all voted Bola Ahmed Tinubu
          (BAT). I was the only Gen-Z around and I voted Peter Obi (PO). From
          the conversation I was unavoidably and passively hearing, the major
          factors during the just concluded presidential election are along the
          lines of tribalism and religion.
        </p>
        <h2>
          On Tribalism:
        </h2>
        <p>
          These 4 men claimed that those who voted PO did so because they do not
          understand the Igbos and their subtle attempt to always dominate other
          tribes where ever they find them, even outside of the Igbos'
          geopolitical zone. Their big motivation for rooting for BAT is because
          he is a Yoruba man and he is capable of putting a stop to that craze.
          BAT being president means the Yorubas will benefit and the Igbos will
          not be able to duplicate Nigeria (as they have done with many
          commodities). They admit that they (the Yorubas) are not altogether
          good but they just don’t trust the Igbos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never heard them talk about the violence and the disenfranchisement
          that led to the election of BAT as the new President of Nigeria but
          they said in the South-East, many hired hands forcefully made non-igbo
          citizens vote PO. They made a certain instance of an elderly man being
          pushed and coerced to vote PO.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them greeted the other in excitement of BAT being
          president-elect but the response was very cold. He replied “is he
          going to be spraying money on the streets? Everyone better buckle up”.
          (I understand this to mean that we’re not sure what he will do as
          president-elect but we’re at least glad a Yoruba is the
          president-elect.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Talks around the Lagos state governorship candidate, Gbadebo
          Rhodes-Vivour (GRV), came up. It happened that one of them was just
          finding out that his roots are traced to the Igbos. He immediately
          raised a cry in Yoruba language, “Igbo ni bobo yan?” “So, wonti debe
          yen naa?” (meaning, so that guy is an igbo? so, they’ve penetrated
          that deep?) At this point, I could almost touch his anger and hurt as
          if it were tangible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another affirmed that his roots are Igbo and he is anticipating how
          the gubernatorial election on March 11 will be terribly attacked by
          the Yorubas. He added that just like some people were disenfranchised,
          much more should be anticipated for the governorship election in
          Lagos. ‘They come to our land (Lagos) and buy our lands, do business
          and don’t even appreciate those who made it possible. It’s like we
          have given them too much allowance, and now they want to rule us!”
          another spoke in dismay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table soon turned and the matters reached General Olusegun
          Obasanjo and how he betrayed his people, the Yorubas, by rooting for
          and accrediting PO. One of the men added that all the General’s effort
          is to make sure that no president beats his record in public office
          and this was the same reason he fought Moshood Kashimawo Abiola (MKO)
          and it was because of this same reason he did Ernest Oladeinde
          Shonekan dirty while he was interim Head of State in 1993. One of them
          further added that the General wants to be known for being to one to
          bring PO out, finding favor in the sight of Nigerians. Another asked
          ‘but what is his gain? He is old and out of office, what is he looking
          for?”
        </p>
        <h2>
          On Religion: 
        </h2>
        <p>
          They claimed pastors/men of God are liars and should never be trusted.
          Their belly is their God and they speak in the direction of what will
          profit them. Also, they said Muslims don’t even profit as much from
          the ruling power because they only fight based on ideas that
          contradict their faith. E.g removal of hijabs in schools. They admit
          that it was indeed a tight, unusual, and shaky election as PO won in
          places they never imagined, e.g Lagos, FCT and other major places they
          had high hopes for. They added that it was because of the engineering
          of men of God who put fear on their large members and laid curses on
          them that they must vote PO. They also added that their members only
          took their dogma and gave their numbers. Another of the 4 men quickly
          added “thank God for the G5 ooo, that was how we were able to pull
          through.”
          </p>
         
         <p> They continued discussing on how tough the election was and how much
          the opposition tried to pull BAT down. One of them said they really
          dragged it with BAT. He made mention of some photoshopped images of
          BAT, how his hands shook in video conferences. Why is his hand not
          shaking again? He asked.</p>
         
          
          <p>The Christian amongst them said “I know all the tricks of these
          Christians, after all, I’m a Christian. They are the ones that come
          out and say I need someone to give me 1 billion”. He also said that he
          has been taking his wife’s church offerings for himself (secretly of
          course, maybe because it serves him better).</p>
       
        <h2>
          On Influencers/Musicians:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Folarin Falana (Falz) was the case study here. They seemed to have a
          consensus that his large involvement in rallying around the election,
          urging people to vote was all for selfish gains. They were sure it was
          only for their musical career. They all concluded that artists like
          Falz only Went in the direction of the majority because they fear for
          their careers/so they will not get canceled. Because if they get
          canceled, that is no stream on their music and if there are no
          streams, that means no money to flex.
          </p>
          <p className='border-b pb-[12px]'>
          Talks came around Dino Melaye and how he was also ‘funded’ in dollars
          by the Atiku group to influence and always raise a finger when he
          sensed foul plays.
        </p>
        
      
        <p>
          It was a long journey and after listening to all of these quietly, I
          was drained. I was teased here and there but I replied no word. After
          some time, I regained myself and I attempted a critical resolve. I
          ended with a fearful and troubling question all the same. You’d agree
          it’s complicated when you read my critical resolve:
          </p>
        <p>
          1. Every single tribe in Nigeria (including the minority tribes like
          Ijaw, Ibibio, Itsekiri, Igala and 250 more) ranging from Millennials
          to Baby Boomers have the above biases these 4 Yoruba men have, toward
          themselves and other tribes. You’ll agree with me that this has almost
          gotten us nowhere. We’re all in a giant rocking chair.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Baby Boomers, Gen-X and Millennials have their reasons for
          holding onto these beliefs. Either they were present when issues that
          led to these beliefs happened or they were taught to hold on to the
          beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. These swampy sets of dividing beliefs are not largely spread
          amongst Gen-Z because they are trying as hard as they can to learn
          unity in diversity. They are more exposed and they are learning to see
          differently than the older generation they are surrounded with in
          their respective tribes.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="styled-blockquote">
          The fearful and troubling thought is that what if these dividing
          beliefs begin to spread like wildfire amongst the Gen-Z as well? As I
          said, they are TRYING TO LEARN but what if the idea of Nigerianism is
          not yet as strong as the idea of tribalism in their hearts and minds?
          What if there are reservations? Should there be reservations? Should
          we say the older generations were best to have held onto these
          reservations?
